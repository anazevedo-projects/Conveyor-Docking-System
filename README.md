This project simulates a logistics distribution conveyor system with multiple docks and dynamic package routing. The system operates with three docks: Dock 1, Dock 2, and Dock End, where packages are delivered based on predefined configurations. The user can set which package types should be delivered to Dock 1 and Dock 2, while all other packages will go to Dock End.

Key Features:

- Dynamic Dock Configuration: Users can configure which package types go to each dock, with the option to change the configuration during operation.
- Dock Availability Monitoring: Docks can be closed or blocked, and the system automatically reroutes packages to available docks. Flashing LEDs indicate blocked or full docks.
- Emergency Stop/Resume: An emergency stop feature is included, with an emergency flashing LED pattern and system pause.
- System State and Statistics: The system provides real-time statistics on package deliveries, including the number of packages processed at each dock, visible through the user interface.
- Idle and Blocked States: The system handles blocked docks and enters a "full blocked state" when all docks are closed, signaling the issue through LED flashing.

The user interface allows for monitoring and controlling the systemâ€™s state, providing visibility into the number of packages processed at each dock and handling operations with an intuitive design.
